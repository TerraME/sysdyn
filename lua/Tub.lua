--- A simple water in the tub model.
-- @arg data.water The initial stock of water measured in gallons. The default value is 40.
-- @arg data.outFlow The flow of water outside the tub each minute. The default is 5.
-- @arg data.inFlow The flow of water into the tub each ten minutes. The default is zero.
-- @arg data.finalTime The final time of the simulation in minutes. The default value is 8.
